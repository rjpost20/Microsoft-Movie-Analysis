![awesome](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-1-project-v2-4/master/awesome.gif)

## Project Overview

This project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) to generate insights for Microsoft Corp. in their undertaking of the creation of a new movie studio. By analyzing film runtimes, genres, ratings, number of ratings, and box office revenues from an IMDb dataset and a box office dataset, I provide three recommendations to Microsoft to maximize the likelihood of success in their creation of new content for their studio.

### Business Problem

Microsoft has seen the success of other major tech companies with the creation of their own film and TV studios, and has decided to undertake their own venture. However, they have limited experience and knowledge on the minutiae of successful content creation. As such, I have been tasked with analyzing the most successful films based on box office records to provide actioniable insights on what types of content are most likely to be successful.
